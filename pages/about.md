# About this Project

This digital archive is part of [Euge Stumm](https://eugestumm.github.io)’s Ph.D. dissertation on gender and sexual dissident language assemblages in Latin America. The development of the corpus data was supervised by Professor Steven Butterman and the implementation of this website was supervised by Professor Susanna Allés-Torrent. We are currently working on a bilingual version (in Portuguese) of this project. 

This project aims at providing scholars and general audiences with: 
* 1\) a departure point for understanding and learning Pajubá
* 2\) a historical and geographical visualization of the language, tracing its differences and similarities through space and time
* 3\) a resource in English for scholarly research on the cryptolect

## What is Pajubá

Pajubá is a cryptolect (a secret language) originally developed by Brazilian travestis and trans women, and eventually adopted by a broader community of gender and sexual dissidents in Brazil. As [Gabriela Araujo](https://repositorio.ufu.br/handle/123456789/21850) highlights, Pajubá's vocabulary includes significant influence of Western African languages (e.g. Yoruba) and European languages (e.g. Italian and French). The use of Pajubá serves as both a form of cultural expression and a means of protection, allowing speakers to communicate safely in hostile environments and marking membership and belonging to each other.

## How This Project Was Made

## Funding and Sustainability
This project received a grant of $1000 dollars from the Digital Humanities Fellowship of the [University of Miami](https://dh.miami.edu). Stemming from a [Minimal Computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about) philosophy, the website is hosted in the form of a static Jekyll webpage through GitHub Pages and the database is hosted by Google Spreadsheets.

## Pajubá Digital Archive Utilizes CollectionBuilder Framework

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-Sheets](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sheets), a template  for creating simple digital exhibit websites by loading collection metadata directly from a CSV, designed for teaching digital library skills and easy hosting on GitHub Pages.

Using CB-Sheets, it is possible to use a live Google Sheets spreadsheet for your collection metadata, allowing you to see the outcome of metadata edits update immediately.
This enables active collaboration to prototype collections with minimal set up.
