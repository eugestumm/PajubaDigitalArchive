# About This Project

This project aims at providing scholars and general audiences with: 
* 1\) a departure point for understanding and learning Pajubá
* 2\) a historical and geographical visualization of the language, tracing its differences and similarities through space and time
* 3\) a resource in English for scholarly research on the cryptolect

This digital archive is part of [Euge Stumm](https://eugestumm.github.io)’s Ph.D. dissertation on gender and sexual dissident language assemblages in Latin America. The development of the corpus data was supervised by Professor Steven Butterman and the implementation of this website was supervised by Professor Susanna Allés-Torrent. 

## How This Project Was Made

For further information on data collection, full access to metadata, and further methodological details, check the section ["Method.](https://eugestumm.github.io/PajubaDigitalArchive/method.html)"

## Pajubá Digital Archive utilizes CollectionBuilder Framework

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-Sheets](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sheets), a template  for creating simple digital exhibit websites by loading collection metadata directly from a CSV, designed for teaching digital library skills and easy hosting on GitHub Pages.

Using CB-Sheets, it is possible to use a live Google Sheets spreadsheet for your collection metadata, allowing you to see the outcome of metadata edits update immediately.
This enables active collaboration to prototype collections with minimal set up.
